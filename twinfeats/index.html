            <h1>Services</h1>
            <p>TwinFeats Software creates innovative, custom web applications which will meet and exceed expectations.
                We will work with you to fully understand your needs but more than that-your data. web applications are all about data,
                and without deeply understanding the needsv of your data. Web applications are
                all about data, and without deeply understanding the needs of your data, your web application will suffer.
            </p>
            <h2>Web Applications? Huh?</h2>
            <p>Web sites are static. The content they display doesn't change dynamically. A web application is a web site
                powered by a database. Facebook is a great example of a web application - the data shown varies by user and
                can change every single second</p>

            <article id="apps">
            <h1>Applications</h1>  
            <p>We've written so many applications in the last 35+ years that we have literally lost count! Applications
                like our FreedomWare line of games for the Commodore 64 are long gone, as are our productivity suite for
                GEOS on the C64 and Amiga.</p>

            <p>Ever use WebEx, GotoMeeting, or Zoom teleconferencing software? We wrote our own back in the 90s for not
                just conferencing, but online learning. Our Android applications range from custom games to productivity
                tools. Web sites and web applications? We've done 'em by the dozens.</p>

            <p>As we like to say, if we can't do it at TwinFeats Software, its a hardware problem!</p>
